[Article I found interesting](https://www.wired.com/story/this-ai-bot-fills-out-job-applications-for-you-while-you-sleep/)


The article above is about a new AI bot that automates the process of applying to jobs for its users. The company that developed this tool is called LazyApply which sums up the product pretty well in my opinion. This tool allows job seekers to upload their resume, set application parameters, and go to bed while the bot applies for jobs overnight. While applying to jobs is a time consuming and rather mundane task, I find this article interesting because it raises questions about fairness and what we know about searching for jobs.
